sampling rate [5 10 30 50 60] hz
window size   [0.5 1 1.5 2] sec
overlap       [0 25 50 75] %

Results files are named with the indices of each list.
F1 scores for each class are save per algorithm so are the macro and micro F1 scores.

Filenams starts with the algorithm name followed by the combination of the 3 parameters.

Eg. 
bayes_1_2_3.json stores the statistics for the combination:
-sampling rate 10
-window size 1.5
-overlap 75

HEADER:
combination | F1 0 | F1 1 | F1 2 | F1 3 | F1 macro | F1 micro 

File combis contain:
combination | nr.sample 0 | nr.samples 1 | nr.samples 2 | nr.samples 3
